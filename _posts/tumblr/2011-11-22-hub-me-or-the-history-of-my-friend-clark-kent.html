<p>I love Github, seriously, I really do. Also, my super coder friend Clark Kent loves too.</p>

<p>Some weeks ago, he decided to create a new project on Github called <a href="https://github.com/clark-kent/krypton" target="_blank">Krypton</a>.</p>

<p>This project is incredible and as the time passed by more and more people started watching and forking it. Awesome!</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>A few days after it he had an idea:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;Hey, what if I created a Github Page to make it even more popular?&#8221;</p>

</blockquote>

<p>So he went to <a href="http://pages.github.com" target="_blank">pages.github.com</a> and discovered that he just needed to go to Admin&#8230;</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_luv2cxtXZh1qe3219.png"/></p>

<p>And check the ‘GitHub Pages’ check box.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_luv2b5LjAU1qe3219.png"/></p>

<p>As every programmer, he&#8217;s a lazy guy.</p>

<p>So when this pop-up appeared, he just clicked on the ‘Automatic GitHub Page Generator’. Even because this generated page is already awesome and he doesn&#8217;t need to spend time coding it.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_luv2dzlLbp1qe3219.png"/></p>

<p>Cool, huh?! Now he can show to everybody his nice project at:</p>

<blockquote>

<p><a href="http://clark-kent.github.com/krypton/" target="_blank">clark-kent.github.com/krypton</a></p>

</blockquote>

<p>Days were passing and he started more and more projects on Github.</p>

<p>Suddenly, he had a lot of nice projects and just wanted to show the world all of his work in a cool way.</p>

<p>So he had an epiphany:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;Hey, I can create Github Pages not just for projects but for users too!&#8221;</p>

</blockquote>

<p>So he went to <a href="http://pages.github.com" target="_blank">pages.github.com</a> again and found out that he just needed to create a repository called <a href="http://clark-kent.github.com" target="_blank">clark-kent.github.com</a> and then push it. That&#8217;s nice, Github really rocks!</p>

<p>But Clark is a lazy guy and doesn&#8217;t have time to code his personal page, he just wants to show the world his projects, the fastest and coolest way possible, without having to code all this html/css thing, just like he did when created krypton project.</p>

<p>So he thought:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;There must be a Github Personal Page Generator too&#8230;&#8221;</p>

</blockquote>

<p>But there wasn&#8217;t =/</p>

<p>So he gave it up. Sad history, huh?</p>

<p>Not anymore! Because now he met a project called <a href="http://github.com/zenorocha/hub.me/" target="_blank">hub.me</a>, where he shows all of his open source projects, organized by languages, with a simple and responsive layout made with HTML5 and CSS3 :)</p>

<p>What a happy ending!</p>

<p>And that&#8217;s all folks, I hope you start using hub.me too :)</p>
