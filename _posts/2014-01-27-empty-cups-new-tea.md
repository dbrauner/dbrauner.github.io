Since I joined GitHub on Sep 14, 2010 I've been creating open source projects
like there's no tomorrow. Several of them ended up being very easy to maintain
but there are few which requires tons of energy.

Some of those projects are very important to the community and, in the last few
months, I didn't have time enough to take care of them the way they deserve. So I
needed to fix that.

There's this chinese proverb that says: *you need to empty your cup if you want
to try new tea*. In other words, sometimes you need to stop giving attention to
some stuff you did in the past, in order to achieve greater or just new things
in the future.

In this mindset, I decided to "recruit" some of the best developers I know to be
the official maintainers of these projects. They are going to discuss issues,
review pull requests and implement new stuff. And here I am to announce them.

## [Browser Diet](http://browserdiet.com)

[Browser Diet](http://browserdiet.com) is a very special project for me, perhaps
the most important that I led last year. It's now translated to 7 different
languages and has more than 1,000 stars on GitHub which means that lots of
people send pull requests and everything.

In order to keep it alive I invited [Djalma
Ara√∫jo](https://github.com/djalmaaraujo), a friend who worked with me at Liferay
and helps me maintain the [CustomElements.io](http://customelements.io) project.
He's a passionated developer and I'm sure he'll take good care of it.

## [Conf Boilerplate](http://braziljs.github.io/conf-boilerplate)

When I first started this project with [Bernard De
Luna](https://github.com/bernarddeluna/), we wanted to provide the easiest
experience possible to create amazing conference websites. So we built this
boilerplate and after couple months more than 20 events were using it.

We're very proud that it helped lots of people but there are still lots of
things we can implement to make it even better and I'm sure [Jean Carlo
Emer](https://github.com/jcemer) will handle that.

## [jQuery Boilerplate](http://jqueryboilerplate.com)

Oh, my first open source experience. [jQuery
Boilerplate](http://jqueryboilerplate.com) taught so many things, which makes
very hard to let it go. However, me and [Addy](https://github.com/addyosmani/)
have been very busy with other projects like Yeoman and WebComponents.org, so we
really need help on this.

[Helder Santana](https://github.com/heldr), an extremely good JavaScript
engineer, will be the one responsible for that now. He's a talented guy, just
like the others, with very good insights that can take the project to the next
level.

## [BrazilJS.org](http://braziljs.org)

Another project that needs attention is BrazilJS Foundation's website. Whenever
you want to find out about what front-end events will happen in Brazil, that's
the place you go. Not only that, latests news, podcasts and projects are
featured there too.

To help the brazilian community even more we invited [Diogo
Moretti](https://github.com/diogomoretti). He's been organizing events and
contributing to BrazilJS's projects for a while. I'm glad we have people
like him in the community.

## Conclusion

Each one of those guys are developers that I trust and admire. I'm sure they
will do a great job and I'm excited to see what's next for these projects.

The truth is, sometimes you just have to admit that you can't embrace the world
and take care of everything by yourself. The hardest part isn't decide what to
do with your time, but what **not** to do.
